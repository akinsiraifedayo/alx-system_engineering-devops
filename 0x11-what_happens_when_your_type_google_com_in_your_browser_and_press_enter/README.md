## Breaking down the journey of Typing "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser

Have you ever wondered what happens when you type "https://www.google.com" in your browser and press Enter? The process might seem simple, but behind the scenes, there are multiple steps involved in making sure that you reach your desired website. Let's take a closer look at the journey your request takes and the various components involved in the process.

## DNS Request

The journey begins with a DNS (Domain Name System) request. When you type a URL (Uniform Resource Locator) in your browser, it needs to be translated into an IP address, which is the unique identifier of a website on the internet. Your browser sends a DNS request to a DNS server, which resolves the URL into an IP address.

## TCP/IP

Once the DNS server returns the IP address, your browser establishes a TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) connection with the web server associated with that IP address. TCP is a protocol that ensures reliable and accurate data transfer over the internet.

## Firewall

Before your request reaches the web server, it may pass through a firewall, which is a security measure that filters and monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic. The firewall may have rules in place to allow or block certain types of requests based on security policies.

## HTTPS/SSL

If the website you're accessing uses HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure), your request is encrypted using SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) or its successor, TLS (Transport Layer Security), to ensure secure communication. This encryption protects your data from being intercepted or tampered with by unauthorized parties.

## Load-Balancer

High-traffic websites often use load-balancers to distribute incoming requests across multiple web servers, ensuring efficient handling of traffic and preventing overloading of a single server. The load-balancer decides which server should handle your request, based on factors like server load, availability, and proximity.

## Web Server

The web server is responsible for handling your request and serving the web page. It receives the encrypted request from your browser, decrypts it using SSL/TLS, and processes the request to retrieve the requested web page from its storage.

## Application Server

In some cases, the web server may communicate with an application server to generate dynamic content. The application server processes requests that require server-side processing, such as running scripts or querying databases, and returns the processed data to the web server.

## Database

If the requested web page requires data from a database, the application server queries the database to retrieve the required information. The database stores and manages data, such as user accounts, product information, or other content, needed to generate the web page.

That's a high-level overview of the journey your request takes when you type a URL in your browser. It involves various components working together to ensure that you can access the desired website. Next time you enter a URL in your browser, you'll have a better understanding of what goes on behind the scenes!
