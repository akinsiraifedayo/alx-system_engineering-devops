# Bash script for SSH connection with private key

This is a Bash script that connects to a remote server with SSH using a private key file.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following:

- A remote server with SSH access
- A private key file (e.g., `id_rsa`) to use for authentication
- The SSH service running on the remote server

## Usage

1. Copy the script to your local machine:

curl -sSL -o connect.sh https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/your-repo/main/connect.sh

typescript
Copy code

Replace `your-username` and `your-repo` with your own GitHub username and repository name.

2. Modify the script to use your own private key file and server IP address. Open `connect.sh` in a text editor and replace the values for `KEY_FILE` and `SERVER_IP` with your own values.

KEY_FILE="~/.ssh/id_rsa"
SERVER_IP="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx"

vbnet
Copy code

Save the changes to the script.

3. Make the script executable by running the following command:

chmod +x connect.sh

bash
Copy code

4. Run the script by entering the following command:

./connect.sh

vbnet
Copy code

This will connect you to your remote server with SSH using your private key.
